	Abstract = {Chromatin is important for the regulation of transcription and other functions, yet the diversity of chromatin composition and the distribution along chromosomes are still poorly characterized. By integrative analysis of genome-wide binding maps of 53 broadly selected chromatin components in Drosophila cells, we show that the genome is segmented into five principal chromatin types that are defined by unique yet overlapping combinations of proteins and form domains that can extend over {\textgreater} 100 kb. We identify a repressive chromatin type that covers about half of the genome and lacks classic heterochromatin markers. Furthermore, transcriptionally active euchromatin consists of two types that differ in molecular organization and H3K36 methylation and regulate distinct classes of genes. Finally, we provide evidence that the different chromatin types help to target DNA-binding factors to specific genomic regions. These results provide a global view of chromatin diversity and domain organization in a metazoan cell. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Rego2008,
	Abstract = {The mammalian inactive X chromosome (Xi) is a model for facultative heterochromatin. Increased DNA compaction for the Xi, and for facultative heterochromatin in general, has long been assumed based on recognition of a distinct Barr body using nucleic-acid staining. This conclusion has been challenged by a report revealing equal volumes occupied by the inactive and active X chromosomes. Here, we use light and electron microscopy to demonstrate in mouse and human fibroblasts a unique Xi ultrastructure, distinct from euchromatin and constitutive heterochromatin, containing tightly packed, heterochromatic fibers/domains with diameters in some cases approaching that of prophase chromatids. Significant space between these packed structures is observed even within condensed regions of the Xi. Serial-section analysis also reveals extensive contacts of the Xi with the nuclear envelope and/or nucleolus, with nuclear envelope association being observed in all cells. Implications of our results for models of Xi gene silencing and chromosome territory organization are discussed.},

@article{Mates2009,
	Abstract = {The Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon is a promising technology platform for gene transfer in vertebrates; however, its efficiency of gene insertion can be a bottleneck in primary cell types. A large-scale genetic screen in mammalian cells yielded a hyperactive transposase (SB100X) with approximately 100-fold enhancement in efficiency when compared to the first-generation transposase. SB100X supported 35-50{\%} stable gene transfer in human CD34(+) cells enriched in hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells. Transplantation of gene-marked CD34(+) cells in immunodeficient mice resulted in long-term engraftment and hematopoietic reconstitution. In addition, SB100X supported sustained ({\textgreater}1 year) expression of physiological levels of factor IX upon transposition in the mouse liver in vivo. Finally, SB100X reproducibly resulted in 45{\%} stable transgenesis frequencies by pronuclear microinjection into mouse zygotes. The newly developed transposase yields unprecedented stable gene transfer efficiencies following nonviral gene delivery that compare favorably to stable transduction efficiencies with integrating viral vectors and is expected to facilitate widespread applications in functional genomics and gene therapy.},

@article{Akhtar2013,
	Abstract = {Reporter genes integrated into the genome are a powerful tool to reveal effects of regulatory elements and local chromatin context on gene expression. However, so far such reporter assays have been of low throughput. Here, we describe a multiplexing approach for the parallel monitoring of transcriptional activity of thousands of randomly integrated reporters. More than 27,000 distinct reporter integrations in mouse embryonic stem cells, obtained with two different promoters, show ???1,000-fold variation in expression levels. Data analysis indicates that lamina-associated domains act as attenuators of transcription, likely by reducing access of transcription factors to binding sites. Furthermore, chromatin compaction is predictive of reporter activity. We also found evidence for crosstalk between neighboring genes and estimate that enhancers can influence gene expression on average over ???20 kb. The multiplexed reporter assay is highly flexible in design and can be modified to query a wide range of aspects of gene regulation. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},
